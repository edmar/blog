I grew up reading science fiction stories. Those stories had a **vision of a future with robots, cheap energy, space exploration, and virtual reality**. This is the future I want to live in. Deep Tech startups are working to make this sci-fi future a reality. I believe humanity's future is bright, but believing is not enough. We need to plan, and we need to act. The best time to start is now.

A Startup faces two main risks: Product Risk and Market Risk. Product risk is the risk that you may not be able to deliver the product to market within the resources (time, money) available to you. Market risk is the risk that the market will not accept your product or service after launching it. Every business has some degree of market risk.

**The category of startups I'm most excited about is Deep Tech**. Deep Tech Startups are companies bringing new technology to the market. They are startups that have more technical risk than market risk while software startups have low technological risk but high market risk. 

**Why I Invested is a Newsletter where I share my journey learning how to invest in Deep Tech. 
You will get an exclusive investment memo describing all my reasoning for every investment I make.**
