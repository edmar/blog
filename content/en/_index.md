Hi, I'm Edmar!

I'm a SaaS Entrepreneur learning how to be an Investor in Deep Tech Startups. I write here about **Deep Tech, Investing, Tools for Thought and Startups in general**. I also host The [Deep Tech Show](https://www.deeptechshow.com/), where I interview Deep Tech investors and founders. 

You can follow my journey by subscribing to **[Why I Invested](/pages/newsletter)**, a Newsletter where I publish a detailed investment memo for every company I decide to invest.
